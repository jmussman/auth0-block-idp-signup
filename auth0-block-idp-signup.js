 * This action is a starter framework to block social and enterprise IdP user registration by
 * deleting the newly created profile and rejecting the login.
 * 
 * There are multiple possibilities for the source of what to block:
 * 
 *  - A list of email addresses or domain names stored in a secret (used here)
 *  - A list of adresses or domain names read from an external source (should be cached for speed)
 *  - A list of addresses or domain names stored in application metadata (works only for the target app)
 * 
 * This example uses a secret in the action, 'block', with the value of a single email to block.
 * 
 * Add the 'auth0' Node.js dependency at the latest version. Add the credentials for an M2M
 * application with delete:users permission in the management API as the domain, clientId,
 * and clientSecret) secrets. Prime the 'block' secret with an email address to test with.
