# Auth0-Block-IdP-Signup

## Overview

When linking a partner IdP as an *enterprise* connection limiting the users from that IdP that may be processed through a signup
and have a profile may be a requirement.

The initial requirement was to build a deny-list of usernames/email or email domain names, but it would be a simple
task to reverse that logic and provide an allow-list of usernames/email that may be processed through.

This is also perfectly useful to look at social-media signups fromn *social* connections and block them as desired.

## Implementation

The implementation prioritizes the event.user.username attribute over the event.user.email attribute.
Once the name is found, it is checked against a deny value.
The example only uses a single username/email value, the starter code may be easily extended
to use an allow or deny list of username/email or email domain names.

If the authenticated username matches the deny value, the even.user.user_id is used to make a Management API
call and remove the profile.
Then, api.access.deny is called to reject tha login.


## Configuration

This assumes basic knowledge of working with actions and adding actions to flows in Auth0.
This is an overview of the configuration that must be established.

### Steps

1. Create or use an existing M2M application configuration that has delete:users permission in the Management API.
2. Create a new post-login action using the code in the *auth0-block-idp-signup.js* file.
3. Add the *auth0* Node.js package as a dependency for the action.
4. Add secrets for *domain*, *clientId*, and *clientSecret* using the values from the application in step 1.
5. Add a secret *block* with an email address to block for testing.
6. Add a secret *debug* with a value of true for console messages during testing, clear it for production. A re-deployment is neccessary after changing a secret.
7. Save and deploy the action in the post-login flow.
